# Discord Token Logger

A simple and efficient tool for automating the management of Discord accounts with custom statuses. This project allows you to login to multiple Discord accounts (using tokens), set dynamic activity statuses (e.g., playing, watching, listening, streaming), and monitor these accounts concurrently.

## Features

- **Login with Discord tokens**: Validate and authenticate using user-provided Discord tokens.
- **Random Activity Generator**: Set dynamic activity statuses like "Playing", "Watching", "Listening", and "Streaming".
- **Concurrent Bot Management**: Support for managing multiple Discord accounts simultaneously.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Print login and status updates to the console with detailed logs.
- **Input Monitoring**: Stop the program by pressing 's' anytime.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `discord.py`: For interacting with Discord's API.
- `requests`: For token validation.
- `pystyle`: For styled output in the terminal.
